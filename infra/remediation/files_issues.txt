    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context ReadOnlyRootFilesystem
        Â· fileservice -> Container has no configured security context
            Set securityContext to run the container in a more secure context.
    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        Â· The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be supported by the CNI
            implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Pod Probes
        Â· Container is missing a readinessProbe
            A readinessProbe should be used to indicate when the service is ready to receive traffic. Without it, the Pod is risking to receive traffic before
            it has booted. It's also used during rollouts, and can prevent downtime if a new version of the application is failing.
