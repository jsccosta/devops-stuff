    [CRITICAL] Container Security Context User Group ID
        Â· client -> Container has no configured security context
            Set securityContext to run the container in a more secure context.
    [CRITICAL] Container Image Tag

            Set securityContext to run the container in a more secure context.
    [CRITICAL] Pod Probes
        Â· Container is missing a readinessProbe
            A readinessProbe should be used to indicate when the service is ready to receive traffic. Without it, the Pod is risking to receive traffic before
            it has booted. It's also used during rollouts, and can prevent downtime if a new version of the application is failing.

    [CRITICAL] Pod NetworkPolicy
        Â· The pod does not have a matching NetworkPolicy
            Create a NetworkPolicy that targets this pod to control who/what can communicate with this pod. Note, this feature needs to be supported by the CNI
            implementation used in the Kubernetes cluster to have an effect.
    [CRITICAL] Container Resources
        Â· client -> CPU limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set resources.limits.cpu
        Â· client -> Memory limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set resources.limits.memory
        Â· client -> CPU request is not set
            Resource requests are recommended to make sure that the application can start and run without crashing. Set resources.requests.cpu
        Â· client -> Memory request is not set
            Resource requests are recommended to make sure that the application can start and run without crashing. Set resources.requests.memory
    [CRITICAL] Container Ephemeral Storage Request and Limit
        Â· client -> Ephemeral Storage limit is not set
            Resource limits are recommended to avoid resource DDOS. Set resources.limits.ephemeral-storage
        Â· client -> Ephemeral Storage request is not set
            Resource requests are recommended to make sure the application can start and run without crashing. Set resource.requests.ephemeral-storage
    [WARNING] Deployment Replicas
        Â· Deployment few replicas
            Deployments targeted by Services are recommended to have at least 2 replicas to prevent unwanted downtime.
